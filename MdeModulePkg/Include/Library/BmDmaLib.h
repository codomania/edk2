  DMA Bus Master Read Operation:
    Call BmDmaMap() for DmaOperationBusMasterRead.
    Program the DMA Bus Master with the DeviceAddress returned by BmDmaMap().
    Start the DMA Bus Master.
    Wait for DMA Bus Master to complete the read operation.
    Call BmDmaUnmap().

  DMA Bus Master Write Operation:
    Call BmDmaMap() for DmaOperationBusMasterWrite.
    Program the DMA Bus Master with the DeviceAddress returned by BmDmaMap().
    Start the DMA Bus Master.
    Wait for DMA Bus Master to complete the write operation.
    Call BmDmaUnmap().

  DMA Bus Master Common Buffer Operation:
    Call BmDmaAllocateBuffer() to allocate a common buffer.
    Call BmDmaMap() for DmaOperationBusMasterCommonBuffer.
    Program the DMA Bus Master with the DeviceAddress returned by BmDmaMap().
    The common buffer can now be accessed equally by the processor and the DMA bus master.
    Call BmDmaUnmap().
    Call BmDmaFreeBuffer().

  @param  Operation             Indicates if the bus master is going to read or write to system memory.
  @param  HostAddress           The system memory address to map to the DMA controller.
  @param  NumberOfBytes         On input the number of bytes to map. On output the number of bytes
                                that were mapped.
  @param  DeviceAddress         The resulting map address for the bus master controller to use to
                                access the hosts HostAddress.
  @param  Mapping               A resulting value to pass to BmDmaUnmap().

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The range was mapped for the returned NumberOfBytes.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The HostAddress cannot be mapped as a common buffer.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One or more parameters are invalid.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The request could not be completed due to a lack of resources.
